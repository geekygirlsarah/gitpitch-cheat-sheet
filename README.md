# GitPitch Cheat Sheet

GitPitch - A slide system built using Markdown and Reveal.js

This cheat sheet is designed to reduce the docs for GitPitch down dramatically to have a good reference source.

---

## Basics

Make everything in a `PITCHME.md` file. Use standard Markdown for all formatting.

### URLs

Github:
`https://gitpitch.com/$user/$repo/$branch`

Gitlab:
`https://gitpitch.com/$user/$repo/$branch?grs=gitlab`

Bitbucket:
`https://gitpitch.com/$user/$repo/$branch?grs=bitbucket`

Start from a certain directory:
`?p=$directory`

### Template Repo

You can pull down [https://github.com/gitpitch/the-template](https://github.com/gitpitch/the-template) and merge those files into your repo for some templates, as well as to have some example slides to look off of.

### Slides

`---` marks a new slide horizontally (right)
`+++` marks a new slide vertically (down)

### Controls

| Keystrokes  | Action  |
|---|---|
| `N` , `Space`, `PageDown` | Next slide |
| `P`, `PageUp` | Previous slide |
| `←` , `H` | Navigate left * |
| `→` , `L` | Navigate right * |
| `↑` , `K` | Navigate up * |
| `↓` , `J` | Navigate down * |
| `Shift + *` | Skip over slide fragments |
| `Home` | First slide |
| `End` | Last slide |
| `B` , `.` | Blackout |
| `F` | Fullscreen |
| `Esc`, `O` | Slide overview |
| `X` | Select Code Block |
| `S` | Speaker notes view |
| `?` | Keyboard shortcuts help screen |

With `mousewheel : true` in the settings you can use the mouse wheel to control slides. (Disabled by default)

With `remote-control : true` in the settings you can use a remote control device with the slides. (Disabled by default)

---

## PITCHME Settings

Use a `PITCHME.yaml` file to store some presentation settings that are loaded with the slide show.

If the file is _not_ there, the presentation halts and you have to add the file.

### Settings

## Template Anatomy

```
.
├── PITCHME.md
├── PITCHME.yaml
└── template
    ├── css
    │   └── PITCHME.css
    ├── img
    │   ├── batman.png
    │   ├── dataflow.png
    │   ├── developer.jpg
    │   ├── einstein.png
    │   └── ....
    └── md

        ├── header-footer/PITCHME.md
        ├── image/PITCHME.md
        ├── list-content/PITCHME.md
        ├── quotation/PITCHME.md

        ├── sidebox/PITCHME.md
        ├── split-screen/PITCHME.md
        └── wrap-up/PITCHME.md
```

Related slides are grouped and maintained within distinct, design-specific `PITCHME.md` markdown files. This provides a modular support.

Custom styling is in `template/css/PITCHME.css`

## Markdown Shortcuts

### Fonts

These can be used on a line alone or in the middle of text.

**Custom font size:**
```
@size[size-value](text)
```
`size-value` can be any valid CSS size (px, em, etc.)

**Custom font color:**

```
@color[color-value](text)
```
`color-value` can be any valid CSS color (white, #ffffff, #fff, etc.)

**Custom CSS class:**
```
@css[class-name](text)
```
`class-name` can be any custom theme class without the period. (so `headline` not `.headline`)

**Custom slide transition**

```
@transition[transition-type]
```
`transition-type` is any supported type (none, slide, fade, convex, concave, zoom) or pair. If paired, use `-in` or `-out` added to the in (like `zoom-in fade-out`)

You cannot use custom transitions with snap layouts.

### Font Awesome

```
@fa[font-awesome-class...]
```
Adds a Font Awesome icon in place in text. You can include colors and other classes here too.

### Rendered emoji (Pro)

```
@emoji[emoji-name]
```

Adds an emoji in place in text.

---

## Markdown Widgets

### Box types

```
@box[type...](text)
```
`type...` is one or more CSS types. These include:
* `rounded` and `waved` or the default (don't specify for a square box)
* some colors with `bg-` and the color (like `bg-white`, `bg-green`, etc.)
* some text colors with `text-` and the color (like `text-white`, `text-green`, etc.)
* custom CSS types

### Rendered quotes
```
@quote[text]
```

Puts text in a rendered box using CSS formatting.

```
@quote[text](attribution-author)
```
Puts text in a rendered formatted box with the attribution or author after it.

### Rendered styled images
```
![PIC](url-src)
```

Inserts an image using the rendered default for the slide.

```
@img[class...](url-src)
```
Inserts an image using any rendered CSS classes associated with images. Specify them with `.reveal img` or optionally add in any sub-class, then add the subclass to the widget.

* Use a `clip-img` class to round an image.
* Use a `bg-` + color class to add a background to transparent images.

## Fragments

Use fragments to separate content that can be advanced through one by one.

### Text Fragments
```
@css[class...](text)
```

To turn text into a fragment.

### Box-text fragments
```
@box[class...](text)
```

Turns text into a box fragment.

### Image fragments
```
@img[fragment](url-src)
```
Turns an image into a fragment.

### Font Awesome Icon Fragment
```
@fa[class...]
```
Turns an Font Awesome Icon into a fragment.

### Snap Layout Fragments
```
@snap[class...]
text
@snapend
```

Turns any snap region into a fragment.

### Table row fragments

```
<table>
   ...
   <tr class="fragment">
      ...
   </tr>
   ...
</table>
```

Turns table rows into individual fragments.

### HTML fragments

```
<tag class="fragment">...</tag>
```

Turns any HTML snippet into a fragment. This works on any element that can take a CSS class attribute.

## Code Presenting

### Gists

```
---?gist=onetapbeyond/494e0fecaf0d6a2aa2acadfb8eb9d6e8
```
to load the Gist and format it with a language, then give it a title on the slide.

Optional parameters include:
- `&lang=js` for language syntax formatting
- `&color=#123456` for a background color
- `&title=text` for a slide title header

### Gist code fragments
```
@[fragment-range]
```
```
@[fragment-range](annotation)
```
to highlight the lines in `fragment-range` and put the optional `annotation` at the bottom of the slide.

### Fenced Code Blocks
````
``` 
code goes here
```
````
This automatically adds syntax highlighting.

````
```language
code goes here
```
````
To add language-specific highlighting. Examples include:
- `bash`, `sh`, `zsh`, etc.
- `c`, `cpp`, `cs`, `csharp`, `c++`, etc.
- `html`
- `haskell`, `hs`
- `javascript`, `js`, `jsx`
- `php`, `php3`, `php4`, `php5`, etc.
- `powershell`, `ps`

and so on. See https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/css-classes-reference.html?highlight=language%20class#language-names-and-aliases for a full list of all languages used by Highlight.js

Set a default code language with the `highlight : lang` setting in `PITCHME.yaml`. 

### Repo Source Files
```
---?code=src/server.go
```

Renders the `src/server.go` file on a slide. Optional parameters include:
- `&lang=js` for language syntax formatting
- `&color=#123456` for a background color
- `&title=text` for a slide title header

### Markdown Files

Use the same format as Repo Source Files above. (`?code=src/file.md`)

---

## Images

### Simple image
```
![alt-title](url-src)
```
inserts a basic image. Local files must be relative to root of the Git repo (ex: `assets/img/logo.png`) or remote files should be prefixed with http:// or https://.

### Background Image
```
---?image=url-src
```
where `url-src` is a local file relative to root of the Git repo (ex: `assets/img/logo.png`) or remote files should be prefixed with http:// or https://.

Optional parameters include:
- `&size=50% 100%` to scale the image. Use any valid CSS background-size values (width, width height, auto, auto auto, or other)
- `&size=auto 90%` to scale a tall image to fit on the slide properly (you can adjust the 90% as desired)
- `&size=contain` to resize the image so that it's fully visible within the slide
- `&size=cover` to resize the image so it completely fills the background, stretching it if need be
- `&color=#123456` to change the background color. Use any valid CSS color value
- `&position=center` to adjust the background position of the image. You can use any `background-position` CSS property, including center, left, right, px values, percentage values, and more. Default is center.
- `&repeat=repeat-x` to repeat the image in a tiled pattern. Any `background-repeat` CSS property can work including no-repeat, repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, space, round, and more. It can be either one syntax or `horizontal vertical` syntax.
- `&transition=fade` to add a transition between slides.

### Background Opacity (Pro)

Add the following parameter to a background image:
```
&opacity=num
``` 
where `num` is a percentage of the capacity (where 0% is perfect transparent and 100% is perfectly opaque).

### Image animations

Make a set of image slides that have minor changes, then name them traisition between each other:
```
---?image=assets/img/grav-open-course-workflow-1.png&size=contain&transition=none

---?image=assets/img/grav-open-course-workflow-2.png&size=contain&transition=none

---?image=assets/img/grav-open-course-workflow-3.png&size=contain&transition=none

---?image=assets/img/grav-open-course-workflow-4.png&size=contain&transition=none
```

### Size limitations

Images over 1 megabyte will not load automatically. This is to help prevent excessive loading time. Use some image editing tools to shrink that down.

---

## Rich Media

### Linear gradients

Add the gradient to a background color slide:
```
---?color=linear-gradient(to left, #123456, #654321)
```
Use https://uigradients.com/ to make some gradients and get CSS codes to use.

### Math formulas

You can use MathJax scripting to display math formulas. 

Example:
```
`\[
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^{\!\!2} \leq
 \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
\]`
```
See https://www.mathjax.org/ to learn about syntax.

It is disabled by default, you'll need to enable it in settings:
```
mathjax : TeX-MML-AM_HTMLorMML-full
```

### Charts

Charts are rendered with Chart.js. Enclose it in `<chart>` tags:

```
<canvas data-chart="line">
<!-- 
{
 "data": {
  "labels": ["January"," February"," March"," April"," May"," June"," July"],
  "datasets": [
   {
    "data":[65,59,80,81,56,55,40],
    "label":"My first dataset","backgroundColor":"rgba(20,220,220,.8)"
   },
   {
    "data":[28,48,40,19,86,27,90],
    "label":"My second dataset","backgroundColor":"rgba(220,120,120,.8)"
   }
  ]
 }, 
 "options": { "responsive": "true" }
}
-->
</canvas>
```

It is disabled by default, it needs to be enabled in the settings:
```
charts : true
```

See https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/tree/master/chart for more information.

### Font Awesome
```
@fa[icon-name]
```
to add an icon. leave off the `fa-` at the beginning of the icon name.

```
@fa[icon-name](title)
```
to add a title attribute to the icon too.

```
@fa[icon-name size]
```
to add the icon with a certain size. Options include fa-lg, fa-2x, fa-3x, fa-4x, fa-5x.

```
@fa[icon-name fa-spin]
```
to spin the icon.

You can add additional CSS classes after the icon-name, size, or spin.

See https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons for the full list of icons.

### Videos

Videos need to be streamed, not added to the repo. 

```
![title](https://player.vimeo.com/video/123456789)
```
will add a Vimeo video.

```
![title](https://www.youtube.com/embed/abcdefghijk)
```
